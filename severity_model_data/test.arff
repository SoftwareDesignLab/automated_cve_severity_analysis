'Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external  credential helper  programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a  blank  pattern to helpers  missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL  and will return some unspecified stored password  leaking the password to an attacker s server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However  the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user  such as Git submodules  or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself  which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However  the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git s  store  helper - Git s  cache  helper - the  osxkeychain  helper that ships in Git s  contrib  directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.',HIGH

'In Anchore Engine version 0.7.0  a specially crafted container image manifest  fetched from a registry  can be used to trigger a shell escape flaw in the anchore engine analyzer service during an image analysis process. The image analysis operation can only be executed by an authenticated user via a valid API request to anchore engine  or if an already added image that anchore is monitoring has its manifest altered to exploit the same flaw. A successful attack can be used to execute commands that run in the analyzer environment  with the same permissions as the user that anchore engine is run as - including access to the credentials that Engine uses to access its own database which have read-write ability  as well as access to the running engien analyzer service environment. By default Anchore Engine is released and deployed as a container where the user is non-root  but if users run Engine directly or explicitly set the user to  root  then that level of access may be gained in the execution environment where Engine runs.

'In Weave Net before version 2.6.3  an attacker able to run a process as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster with an IPv4 internal network  if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline)  it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces  but it s pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled  ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default  /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router advertisements  an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before  if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records  many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4  giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year s RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462)  you can now escalate to the host.

'The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled.

There even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users  which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable  and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different permission that s more restrictive.',HIGH

'** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links.  1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong s docker-compose template  and not Kong s docker image itself. In reality  this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such  the description stating  An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.  is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong  and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a  Patch  link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However  instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions   which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly  the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.

'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing guest OS users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write unlock paths don t contain a memory barrier. On Arm  this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words  the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the  critical  section. As a consequence  it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words  many of the assumptions (e.g.  a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones)  so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance  there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory  or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.',HIGH

'Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop  the current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer  as well as by the option delta and option length bytes. The actual input packet length is not verified against the number of bytes read when processing the option extended delta and the option extended length. Moreover  the calculation of the message_left variable  in the case of non-extended option deltas  is incorrect and indicates more data left for processing than provided in the function input. All of these lead to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Depending on the platform-specific memory management mechanisms  it can lead to processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation errors.',HIGH
'A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options  packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct range  but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory  not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result  access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.',HIGH
'An infinite loop was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets.

This loop s exit condition is computed using the previously allocated heap memory required for storing the result of parsing multiple options. If the input heap memory calculation results in zero bytes  the loop exit condition is never met and the loop is not terminated. As a result  the packet parsing function never exits  leading to resource consumption.',HIGH

The length of the token in the received message is provided in the first byte parsed by the sn_coap_parser_options_parse() function. The length encoded in the message is not validated against the actual input buffer length before accessing the token. As a result  memory access outside of the intended boundary of the buffer may occur.',HIGH
'Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3 when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection  it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and results in the same option number being processed again in a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY  COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH  COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY  and COAP_OPTION_ETAG  there is no check on whether memory has already been allocated  which in conjunction with the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result  the memory is never freed.',HIGH

The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message s requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. If the number of variables in the request exceeds the allocated buffer  a memory write out of the buffer boundaries occurs. This write operation provides a possibility to overwrite other variables allocated in the .bss section by the application. Because the sender of the frame is in control of the content that will be written beyond the buffer limits  and there is no strict process memory separation  this issue may allow overwriting of sensitive memory areas of an IoT device.',HIGH
'Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5  in the SNMP bulk get request response encoding function. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not verify the input message s requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine buffer. When a bulk get request response is assembled  a stack buffer dedicated for OIDs (with a limited capacity) is allocated in snmp_engine_get_bulk(). When snmp_engine_get_bulk() is populating the stack buffer  an overflow condition may occur due to lack of input length validation. This makes it possible to overwrite stack regions beyond the allocated buffer  including the return address from the function. As a result  the code execution path may be redirected to an address provided in the SNMP bulk get payload.

'In TimelineJS before version 3.7.0  some user data renders as HTML. An attacker could implement an XSS exploit with maliciously crafted content in a number of data fields. This risk is present whether the source data for the timeline is stored on Google Sheets or in a JSON configuration file. Most TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a Google Sheets document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker  if the access of a trusted user is compromised  or if they grant public write access to the document. Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document. Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write access to the document to a malicious inside attacker  if the access of a trusted user is compromised  or if write access to the system hosting that document is otherwise compromised. Version 3.7.0 of TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. For content which is intended to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking  that content is  sanitized  before being added to the DOM. For content intended for simple text display  all markup is stripped. Very few users of TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users will automatically begin using the new code**.

'Django Two-Factor Authentication before 1.12  stores the user s password in clear text in the user session (base64-encoded). The password is stored in the session when the user submits their username and password  and is removed once they complete authentication by entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary amount of time  and potentially forever if the user begins the login process by entering their username and password and then leaves before entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in the worst case  if you re using Django s default database session storage  then users  passwords are stored in clear text in your database. In the best case  if you re using Django s signed cookie session  then users  passwords are only stored in clear text within their browser s cookie store. In the common case of using Django s cache session store  the users  passwords are stored in clear text in whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading  users should be sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For example  if you re using the database session backend  you ll likely want to delete any session record from the database and purge that data from any database backups or replicas. In addition  affected organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an affected version should inform their users that their clear text passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords on any sites where they were used. As a workaround  wwitching Django s session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache lessens the impact of this issue  but should not be done without a thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to fully mitigate the issue without upgrading.',MEDIUM

'In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4  2.0.3  2.1.2  2.2.1 and 2.3.1  saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs  each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors  indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However  some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario  the flatbuffer model uses a negative -1 value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately  this means that the -1 index is a valid tensor index for any operator  including those that don t expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus  this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays  although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets  albeit very limited in scope.

The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1  or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom Verifier to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are sorted  although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps  then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.',HIGH

'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86 HVM guests  dirty video RAM tracking code allows such guests to make Xen de-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped space. A malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash  resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen versions from 4.8 onwards are affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the vulnerability. In addition  there needs to be an entity actively monitoring a guest s video frame buffer (typically for display purposes) in order for such a guest to be able to leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV guests  as well as x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP)  cannot leverage the vulnerability.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing Arm guest OS users to cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed. On Arm  the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment. Unfortunately  there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result  a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash  resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU  changes to them require flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore  IOMMUs may be non-coherent  and hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs  a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen s free pool  and later reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP)  having a passed through PCI device assigned  and having page table sharing enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page size support compatible.',HIGH
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing guest OS users to cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-channel port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use  (2) the memory allocation failed  or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than what is supported by the ABI (e.g.  2L or FIFO) used by the guest or the limit set by an administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due to the missing error checks  only (1) will be considered an error. All the other cases will provide a valid port and will result in a crash when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels  that guest may be able to crash the host. When Xen is out-of-memory  allocation of new event channels will result in crashing the host rather than reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All architectures are affected. The default configuration  when guests are created with xl/libxl  is not vulnerable  because of the default event-channel limit.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x  allowing Intel guest OS users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-atomic modification of a live EPT PTE. When mapping guest EPT (nested paging) tables  Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and optimisation flags  Xen might expose a dangerous partially written PTE to the hardware  which an attacker might be able to race to exploit. A guest administrator or perhaps even an unprivileged guest user might be able to cause denial of service  data corruption  or privilege escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems using AMD CPUs  and Arm systems  are not vulnerable. Only systems using nested paging (hap  aka nested paging  aka in this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write  or (b) a series of read-modify-write operations in the same order as the source code  the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example  in one test build using GCC 8.3 with normal settings  the compiler generated multiple (unlocked) read-modify-write operations in source-code order  which did not constitute a vulnerability. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source code clearly violates the C rules  and thus should be considered vulnerable.',HIGH

'Specific IPv6 packets sent by clients processed by the Routing Engine (RE) are improperly handled. These IPv6 packets are designed to be blocked by the RE from egressing the RE. Instead  the RE allows these specific IPv6 packets to egress the RE  at which point a mbuf memory leak occurs within the Juniper Networks Junos OS device. This memory leak eventually leads to a kernel crash (vmcore)  or the device hanging and requiring a power cycle to restore service  creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. During the time where mbufs are rising  yet not fully filled  some traffic from client devices may begin to be black holed. To be black holed  this traffic must match the condition where this traffic must be processed by the RE. Continued receipt and attempted egress of these specific IPv6 packets from the Routing Engine (RE) will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Scenarios which have been observed are: 1. In a single chassis  single RE scenario  the device will hang without vmcore  or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario the device needs to be power cycled. 2. In a single chassis  dual RE scenario  the device master RE will fail over to the backup RE. In this scenario  the master and the backup REs need to be reset from time to time when they vmcore. There is no need to power cycle the device. 3. In a dual chassis  single RE scenario  the device will hang without vmcore  or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario  the two chassis  design relies upon some type of network level redundancy - VRRP  GRES  NSR  etc. - 3.a In a commanded switchover  where nonstop active routing (NSR) is enabled no session loss is observed. 4. In a dual chassis  dual chassis scenario  rely upon the RE to RE failover as stated in the second scenario. In the unlikely event that the device does not switch RE to RE gracefully  then the fallback position is to the network level services scenario in the third scenario.

'This issue occurs on Juniper Networks Junos OS devices which do not support Advanced Forwarding Interface (AFI) / Advanced Forwarding Toolkit (AFT). Devices using AFI and AFT are not exploitable to this issue. An improper initialization of memory in the packet forwarding architecture in Juniper Networks Junos OS non-AFI/AFT platforms which may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability being exploited when a genuine packet is received and inspected by non-AFT/AFI sFlow and when the device is also configured with firewall policers. This first genuine packet received and inspected by sampled flow (sFlow) through a specific firewall policer will cause the device to reboot. After the reboot has completed  if the device receives and sFlow inspects another genuine packet seen through a specific firewall policer  the device will generate a core file and reboot. Continued inspection of these genuine packets will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Depending on the method for service restoration  e.g. hard boot or soft reboot  a core file may or may not be generated the next time the packet is received and inspected by sFlow.

If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled  the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes   match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled  there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use  this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled  this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution  we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns  =*;*&  or  *\%3b*&  in /var/log/httpd.log  using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log   match  =*;*& =*\%3b*&  If this command returns any output  it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed  using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz   match  =*;*& =*\%3b*&  user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz   match  =*;*& =*\%3b*&  Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file  thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.

One of Xen s sanitization paths injects a #GP fault  and incorrectly delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to observe a kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a user-privilege #GP fault (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.). Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest kernel  resulting in a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel  Centaur  and Shanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid. Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that an event channel  once valid  will not become invalid over the life time of a guest. However  operations like the resetting of all event channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering  crashing the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen  leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86 PV guests  this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests  and for all ARM guests  this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default  so systems using exclusively xl  libvirt+libxl  or their own toolstack based on libxl  and not explicitly setting max_event_channels  are not vulnerable.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in the XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. The RCU (Read  Copy  Update) mechanism is a synchronisation primitive. A buggy error path in the XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference  which is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This causes subsequent administration operations  (e.g.  CPU offline) to livelock  resulting in a host Denial of Service. The buggy codepath has been present since Xen 4.12. Xen 4.14 and later are vulnerable to the DoS. The side effects are believed to be benign on Xen 4.12 and 4.13  but patches are provided nevertheless. The vulnerability can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs  as these are generally the only type of VM that have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains  as well as ARM VMs  typically don t use a stubdomain. Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains  or with emulators running in dom0  cannot exploit the vulnerability.',MEDIUM

Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by itself covered by XSA-77) can lead to the violation of various internal assumptions. This may lead to out of bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks. In particular  x86 PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to that of the host. Host and guest crashes are also possible  leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leaks cannot be ruled out. All Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.',HIGH

'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event channels are available to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level event channel model imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels  due to limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure  whereas all other domains can use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limit during domain initialization  however  has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be 64-bit ones  prior to actually honoring respective domain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones  the limit didn t get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen  32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail. Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared info structure. An unprivileged guest may cause another domain  in particular Domain 0  to misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable. Arm systems  as well as x86 64-bit domains  are not vulnerable.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of preemption in evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular  the FIFO event channel model allows guests to have a large number of event channels active at a time. Closing all of these (when resetting all event channels or when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended periods of time. So far  there was no arrangement for preemption at suitable intervals  allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount of time in the processing of these operations. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. All Xen versions are vulnerable in principle. Whether versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying hardware characteristics.',MEDIUM
'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. An x86 PV guest can trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers  Xen first reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR  which is an Intel specific MSR  this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault  which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen  resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked.

'An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed lockless as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory barrier (e.g.  smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all systems  the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.',HIGH

'The DuoConnect client enables users to establish SSH connections to hosts protected by a DNG instance. When a user initiates an SSH connection to a DNG-protected host for the first time using DuoConnect  the user   s browser is opened to a login screen in order to complete authentication determined by the contents of the  -relay  argument. If the    -relay    is set to a URL beginning with  http://   then the browser will initially attempt to load the URL over an insecure HTTP connection  before being immediately redirected to HTTPS (in addition to standard redirect mechanisms  the DNG uses HTTP Strict Transport Security headers to enforce this). After successfully authenticating to a DNG  DuoConnect stores an authentication token in a local system cache  so users do not have to complete this browser-based authentication workflow for every subsequent SSH connection. These tokens are valid for a configurable period of time  which defaults to 8 hours. If a user running DuoConnect already has a valid token  then instead of opening a web browser  DuoConnect directly contacts the DNG  again using the configured  -relay  value  and sends this token  as well as the intended SSH server hostname and port numbers. If the  -relay  argument begins with  http://   then this request will be sent over an insecure connection  and could be exposed to an attacker who is sniffing the traffic on the same network. The DNG authentication tokens that may be exposed during SSH relay may be used to gain network-level access to the servers and ports protected by that given relay host.

'In WatermelonDB (NPM package  @nozbe/watermelondb ) before versions 0.15.1 and 0.16.2  a maliciously crafted record ID can exploit a SQL Injection vulnerability in iOS adapter implementation and cause the app to delete all or selected records from the database  generally causing the app to become unusable. This may happen in apps that don t validate IDs (valid IDs are /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/) and use Watermelon Sync or low-level database.adapter.destroyDeletedRecords method. The integrity risk is low due to the fact that maliciously deleted records won t synchronize  so logout-login will restore all data  although some local changes may be lost if the malicious deletion causes the sync process to fail to proceed to push stage. No way to breach confidentiality with this vulnerability is known. Full exploitation of SQL Injection is mitigated  because it s not possible to nest an insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite  and it s not possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There s also no known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively deleting records  because those records will not be synchronized.

In such a scenario  on 32 bit machines  Basic Station would execute a code path  where a piece of memory is accessed after it has been freed  causing the process to crash and restarted again.

'In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0  a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database  including escalating the attacker s privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence  the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability  clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately  you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term  isolated  refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).',HIGH

'In django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist before 0.3.4  a potential timing attack exists on websites where the basic authentication is used or configured  i.e. BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD is set.

This enables a possibility that attacker may time the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and password  and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials. This attack is understood not to be realistic over the Internet. However  it may be achieved from within local networks where the website is hosted  e.g. from inside a data centre where a website s server is located. Sites protected by IP address whitelisting only are unaffected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed on version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to version 0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and password configured on a Django project using this package.

'Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external  credential helper  programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream  causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g.  good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g.  evil.example.com)  resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two  meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone.

'Multiple ZyXEL network-attached storage (NAS) devices running firmware version 5.21 contain a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability  which may allow a remote  unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device. ZyXEL NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters  it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although the web server does not run as the root user  ZyXEL devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such  it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device  a remote  unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker. However  there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices. For example  simply visiting a website can result in the compromise of any ZyXEL device that is reachable from the client system.

After changing the LDAP connection IP address  subsequent authentication attempts will result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory) credentials to the actor. Although the credentials may belong to a non-privileged user  organizations frequently use privileged service accounts to bind to Active Directory.
